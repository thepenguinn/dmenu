# My build of suckless's dmenu

This is my build of [suckless's](https://suckless.org) [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/).
For more information on building and configuring dmenu, vist dmenu's home
[page](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/).

# This is a broken build

I think I messed something up, for some reason dmenu doesn't show up when
invoked. Need to debug.

# Patches

`./patches` directory contains all the patches applied to this build. Other
than patches from suckless website, I've also added some modifications to the
source code, including the ability to mass marking entries, ability to attach
to corners and edges, and a vi mode (kind of...).
